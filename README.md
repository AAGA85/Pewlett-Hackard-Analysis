# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Pewlett-Hackard is a large company with boasting several thousand employees with a great and long history. As many other companies ...con gran permanencia en el mercado..., this company is facing one of the most recent issues, the retirment of the Baby Boomers. According to the estatistics, this population could be very large and with their retirement also means a very large gap to be filled. Their retirement will increase the number of vacancies but at the same time that will create a shortage of skilled professionals. 

Nevertheless Pewlett-Hackard is very consious of this situation and has developed a plan of two vias: the first action is to offer a retirement package and the second action is to be clear with the number of job openings once those candidates to package retirement leave their positions.  The company needs to be prepared for this plan as soon as posible becuase they know this situacion could be a problem of productivity in the near future.

For that reason the company has tasked Bobby consiente (an HR analyst) to perform an employee research. There are two important questions to be answered: 

1. Who will be retiring in the next few years?
2. How many positions will Pewlett Hackard need to fill?

Fortunatelly, the company has decided to update the way to get and analyze data: from Excel and VBA to SQL. That is an important upgrade considering the large amount of data to be analyzed by Bobby to answer the questions above.
